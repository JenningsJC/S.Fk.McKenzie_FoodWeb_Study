#### _Background_
##### The South Fork of the McKenzie River (SFMR), Oregon, is a heavily-modified system, with a high headwater dam about 4 miles from its confluence with the mainstem McKenzie River. The alluvial floodplain below the dam was once productive chinook and trout spawning and rearing habitat. After dam construction, it became a single channel system engineered for efficient flow away from the dam, with poor connectivity to the flood plain, an altered flow regime, and substrate dominated by large embedded cobbles with little gravel. The modified stream segment was still quite productive for many trout, but poor spawning habitat for chinook.

#### _Restoration Method_
##### Under the Stream Evolution Model, Stage 0 is the hydro-geological and ecological state of a stream system before human modification, with ecosystem services intact, diverse food webs and habitats, and dynamic natural processes at play. Stage 0 restoration of the lowest reach of the SFMR was accomplished during the summer of 2018. The river was diverted from the main channel, tractors filled it in with aggregates and sediments and leveled berms and other flood plain modifications in order to return to pre-modified flood plain conditions. The river was then slowly returned to the main channel and allowed to push the fill material, along with hundreds of logs placed by helicopter, wherever the natural flood process dictated. This restoration method employs natural processes within the alluvial floodplain to reestablish side-channels and pools, restore groundwater connectivity, create a diversity of habitats and aquatic communities, and evolve over time as environmental conditions change.

#### _Post-Restoration Food Web Study_
##### After completing the first phase of stream restoration in the summer of 2018, the aquatic food web in: 1)a restored lower reach and 2)two unrestored upstream reference reaches were sampled seasonally from the Summer of 2019 through the summer of 2020. The benthos (N=5) and submerged wood surfaces (N=3) were sampled for aquatic invertebrates, using a stratified random sampling approach within each unit, sub-sampling across the distribution of sub-patches (riffles, pools,...) proportionally to their overall cover. Fish diets were also collected via gastric lavage. Fin tissue, invertebrate tissue and plant tissue from instream and riparian zone were collected for isotopic analysis. Annual biomass (B) estimates will be derived from the seasonal samples. Monthly samples (N=3) were collected in the reference reach to estimate cohort production intervals and to obtain annual estimates of mean abundance by size-class for each taxon, in order to calculate secondary production (P) and P/B rates by reach, using the size-frequency method. P/B estimates will be combined with the annual estimates of B derived from the seasonal samples to obtain overall estimates of annual P by reach (P/B*annual B = annual P).
